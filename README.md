# Java

Java follows the priciples of object oriented programming,are quiet popular as they help in reducing the complexity of programs.

Eg:as library management and inventory management,needs object oriented language,such as Java.

Basic Defnitions:

Class:
Characteristics and behaviour of an object.Example:If u r creating a game application,each game which user plays from application are equivalent to a class.

Attributes like score,players can be specified as member variables and their behaviour is mentioned as methods.

class<Class Name>
{

//Declaration of member variables 

//Declaration of methods

}

Keypoints:

Name of class is equivalent to name of file.(if main class is declared public).

First letter must be capitalised.

Class name should not be a keyword.

Variables:

Container for storage of data.

<datatype> <variable name>

Methods:

Statements which are intended to form a specific task.

A method called compute score can be used as a method in above example.

<Access specifiers><return type><method name>(parameter list)
//method declaration
{
  <Method Body>
}

Objects:

Instance of a class and has unique identity.

class name object name;//declaration of object of a class.

object name=new class name();//create an object;new keyword allocates memory to object.
